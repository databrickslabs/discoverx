# Contributing

We happily welcome contributions to DiscoverX. We use GitHub Issues to track community reported issues and GitHub Pull Requests for accepting changes.

## Local environment setup

While using this project, you need Python 3.X and `pip` or `conda` for package management.

1. Instantiate a local Python environment via a tool of your choice. This example is based on `conda`, but you can use any environment management tool:
```bash
conda create -n discoverx python=3.9
conda activate discoverx
```

2. If you don't have JDK installed on your local machine, install it (in this example we use `conda`-based installation):
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge openjdk=11.0.15
```

3. Install project locally (this will also install dev requirements):
```bash
pip install -e ".[local,test]"
```

## Running unit tests

For unit testing, please use `pytest`:
```
pytest tests/unit --cov
```

Please check the directory `tests/unit` for more details on how to use unit tests.
In the `tests/unit/conftest.py` you'll also find useful testing primitives, such as local Spark instance with Delta support, local MLflow and DBUtils fixture.

## CI/CD pipeline settings

Please set the following secrets or environment variables for your CI provider:
- `DATABRICKS_HOST`
- `DATABRICKS_TOKEN`

## Testing and releasing via CI pipeline

- To trigger the CI pipeline, simply push your code to the repository. If CI provider is correctly set, it shall trigger the general testing pipeline
- To trigger the release pipeline, get the current version from the `discoverx/__init__.py` file and tag the current code version:
```
git tag -a v<your-project-version> -m "Release tag for version <your-project-version>"
git push origin --tags
```
