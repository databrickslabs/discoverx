# DiscoverX

Multi-table operations over the lakehouse.

![Multi-table operations](docs/images/DiscoverX_Multi-table_operations.png)

Run a single command to execute operations across many tables. 

## Operations examples

Operations are applied concurrently across multiple tables

* **Maintenance**
  * [VACUUM all tables](docs/Vacuum.md) ([example notebook](examples/vacuum_multiple_tables.py))
  * OPTIMIZE with z-order on tables having specified columns
  * Detect tables having too many small files ([example notebook](examples/detect_small_files.py))
  * Visualise quantity of data written per table per period
* **Governance**
  * PII detection with Presidio ([example notebook](examples/pii_detection_presidio.py))
  * Text Analysis with MosaicML and Databricks MLflow ([example notebook](examples/text_analysis_mosaicml_mlflow.py))
  * Text Analysis with OpenAI GPT ([example notebook](examples/text_analysis_openai_gpt.py))
  * [GDPR right of access: extract user data from all tables at once](docs/GDPR_RoA.md)
  * [GDPR right of erasure: delete user data from all tables at once](docs/GDPR_RoE.md)
  * [Search in any column](docs/Search.md)
* **Semantic classification**
  * [Semantic classification of columns by semantic class](docs/Semantic_classification.md): email, phone number, IP address, etc.
  * [Select data based on semantic classes](docs/Select_by_class.md)
  * [Delete data based on semantic classes](docs/Delete_by_class.md)
* **Custom**
  * [Arbitrary SQL template execution across multiple tables](docs/Arbitrary_multi-table_SQL.md)
  * Create Mlflow gateway routes for MosaicML and OpenAI ([example notebook](examples/mlflow_gateway_routes_examples.py))

## Getting started

Install DiscoverX, in Databricks notebook type

```
%pip install dbl-discoverx
```

Get started

```
from discoverx import DX
dx = DX(locale="US")
```

You can now run operations across multiple tables. 

As an illustration, consider the scenario where you need to retrieve a single row from various tables within a catalog that begins with "dev_" and includes the term "sample" in their names. To achieve this, the following code block utilizes the dx.from_tables function, which applies an SQL query to extract JSON-formatted data:

```
dx.from_tables("dev_*.*.*sample*")\
  .with_sql("SELECT to_json(struct(*)) AS row FROM {full_table_name} LIMIT 1")\
  .apply()
```

## Available functionality

The available `dx` functions are

* `from_tables("<catalog>.<schema>.<table>")` selects tables based on the specified pattern (use `*` as a wildcard). Returns a `DataExplorer` object with methods
  * `having_columns` restricts the selection to tables that have the specified columns
  * `with_concurrency` defines how many queries are executed concurrently (10 by defailt)
  * `with_sql` applies a SQL template to all tables. After this command you can apply an [action](#from_tables-actions). See in-depth documentation [here](docs/Arbitrary_multi-table_SQL.md).
  * `unpivot_string_columns` returns a melted (unpivoted) dataframe with all string columns from the selected tables. After this command you can apply an [action](#from_tables-actions)
  * `scan` (experimental) scans the lakehouse with regex expressions defined by the rules and to power the semantic classification.
* `intro` gives an introduction to the library
* `scan` scans the lakehouse with regex expressions defined by the rules and to power the semantic classification. [Documentation](docs/Semantic_classification.md)
* `display_rules` shows the rules available for semantic classification
* `search` searches the lakehouse content for by leveraging the semantic classes identified with scan (eg. email, ip address, etc.). [Documentation](docs/Search.md)
* `select_by_class` selects data from the lakehouse content by semantic class. [Documentation](docs/Select_by_class.md)
* `delete_by_class` deletes from the lakehouse by semantic class. [Documentation](docs/Delete_by_class.md)


### from_tables Actions

After a `with_sql` or `unpivot_string_columns` command, you can apply the following actions:

* `explain` explains the queries that would be executed
* `display` executes the queries and shows the first 1000 rows of the result in a unioned dataframe
* `apply` returns a unioned dataframe with the result from the queries

## Requirements

* A [Databricks workspace](https://www.databricks.com/try-databricks#account)
* [Unity Catalog](https://www.databricks.com/product/unity-catalog)
