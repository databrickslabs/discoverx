# DiscoverX

Scan, Classify, and Discover the content of your Lakehouse.

## Getting started

Install DiscoverX, in Databricks notebook type

```
%pip install dbl-discoverx
```

Get started

```
from discoverx import DX
dx = DX(locale="US")
```

## Scan & classify

You can scan a sample of 10k rows from each table with

```
dx.scan(from_tables="*.*.*")
```

Check out the [scan parameters](#scan-parameters) for more details.

The scan result is a dataset with a `score` column, which defines the fraction of matched records against the total records scanned for each rule.

### Available classes

The supported classes are:
- IP v4 addresses
- IP v6 addresses
- Email addresses
- URLs
- fqdn (Fully qualified domain names)
- Credit card number
- Credit card expiration date
- Iso date
- Iso date time
- Mac address

US locale specific classes
- us_mailing_address
- us_phone_number
- us_social_security_number
- us_state
- us_state_abbreviation
- us_zip_code

See the list of available classification rules with 

```
dx.display_rules()
```

You can also provide your [custom matching rules](#custom-rules).


## Save & Load the Scan Results

After a `scan` you can save the scan results in a delta table of your choice.

```
dx.save(full_table_name=<your-table-name>)
```

To load the saved results at a later time or in a different session use

```
dx.load(full_table_name=<your-table-name>)
```

## Cross-table queries

After a `scan` you can leverage the classified column classes to run cross-table `search`, `delete_by_class` and `select_by_classes` actions.


### Search

Search for a specific value across multiple tables.

```
dx.search("example_email@databricks.com", from_tables="*.*.*")
```

The search will automatically try to classify the search term and restrict the search to columns that match that rule classes.

You can also specify the classes where the search should be performed explicitly:

```
dx.search("example_email@databricks.com", from_tables="*.*.*", by_classes=["dx_email"])
```

If you want to limit the search to columns with a specific classification score
you need to provide it as parameter, i.e.

```
dx.search("example_email@databricks.com", from_tables="*.*.*", min_score=0.95)
```

The score refers to the frequency of matching rules during the scan for
the respective column.

### Delete

Delete 

Preview delete statements
```
dx.delete_by_class(from_tables="*.*.*", by_class="dx_email", values=['example_email@databricks.com'], yes_i_am_sure=False, min_score=0.95)
```

Execute delete statements
```
dx.delete_by_class(from_tables="*.*.*", by_class="dx_email", values=['example_email@databricks.com'], yes_i_am_sure=True, min_score=0.95)
```

Note: You need to regularly [vacuum](https://docs.delta.io/latest/delta-utility.html#remove-files-no-longer-referenced-by-a-delta-table) all your delta tables to remove all traces of your deleted rows. 

### Select

Select all columns classified with specified classes from multiple tables

```
dx.select_by_classes(from_tables="*.*.*", by_classes=["dx_iso_date", "dx_email"], min_score=None)
```

You can apply further transformations to build your summary tables. 
Eg. Count the occurrence of each IP address per day across multiple tables and columns

```
df = (dx.select_by_classes(from_tables="*.*.*", by_classes=["dx_iso_date", "dx_ip_v4"])
    .groupby(["table_catalog", "table_schema", "table_name", "classified_columns.dx_iso_date.column", "classified_columns.dx_iso_date.value", "classified_columns.dx_ip_v4.column"])
    .agg(func.count("classified_columns.dx_ip_v4.value").alias("count"))
)
```


## Configuration

### Scan parameters

You can define 

```
dx.scan(
    from_tables="*.*.*", # Table pattern in form of <catalog>.<schema>.<table> ('*' is a wildcard)
    rules="*",           # Rule filter ('*' is a wildcard)
    sample_size=10000,   # Number of rows to sample, use None for a full table scan
    what_if=False        # If `True` it prints the SQL that would be executed
)
```

### Custom rules

You can provide your custom scanning rules based on regex expressions.

```
custom_rules = [
    {
        'name': 'resource_request_id',
        'type': 'regex',
        'description': 'Resource request ID',
        'definition': r'^AR-\d{9}$',
        'match_example': ['AR-123456789'],
        'nomatch_example': ['CD-123456789']
    }
]
dx = DX(custom_rules=custom_rules)
```

You should now see your rules added to the default ones with

```
dx.display_rules()
```
